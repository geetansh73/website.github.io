<h3><em>For thousands of tech professionals in some of the most vibrant tech markets,It is the best place to learn about the industry, build connections at events and carve out futures at companies they believe in.</em></h3>
<h3><em>Pursuing a BTech course with a specialization can help engineering students become better skilled than pursuing a traditional BTech.</em></h3>
<h3><em>What's the problem with a traditional BTech course?
In a country that is seeing an unprecedented rise in manufacturing and innovation across domains, there is a stiff competition among engineering individuals to avail these limited jobs.

The smaller organizations, then, particularly those in increasingly non-urban areas and less understood or explored territories, the battle is to get enough candidates just to fill their jobs, not to mention, fill the void for specialists.</em></h3>
<h3><em>
How are universities perpetrating the problem of unskilled engineers?
A ton of the engineering universities fail to build the much-needed skills in their students which eventually plays into their absence of their employability.</em></h3>
<h3><em>How does a BTech with specialisation make our engineers better skilled?
When one looks at the engineering vocation, it is evident that the profession is as old as mankind itself. But this profession was predominantly shaped during the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, where the ones developing the field were spearheading the education in engineering too.</em></h3>
