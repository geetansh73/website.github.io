<h1><strong>What Is Cloud Computing?</strong></h1>
<h3>Cloud computing refers to any kind of hosted service delivered over the internet. These services often include servers, databases, software, networks, analytics and other computing functions that can be operated through the cloud.

Files and programs stored in the cloud can be accessed anywhere by users on the service, eliminating the need to always be near physical hardware. In the past, for example, user-created documents and spreadsheets had to be saved to a physical hard drive, USB drive or disk. Without some kind of hardware component, the files were completely inaccessible outside the computer they originated on. Thanks to the cloud, few people worry anymore about fried hard drives or lost or corrupted USB drives. Cloud computing makes the documents available everywhere because the data actually lives on a network of hosted servers that transmit data over the internet. </h3>

<h4><strong>WHAT ARE CLOUD COMPANIES?</strong></h4>
<h3><em>Cloud companies, sometimes referred to as Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), are companies that offer services or applications on the cloud. These cloud companies essentially host tools and data centers that allow customers to retrieve and utilize information in a flexible, manageable and cost-effective manner. Through cloud companies, customers can easily access their cloud-based data via any network connection.</em></h3>
<h3><strong>Cloud Computing Service Types</strong></h3>
<h3>Cloud computing services are broken down into three major categories: software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).</h3>
<h3><strong>Software-as-a-Service</strong></h3>
<h3>SaaS is the most common cloud service type. Many of us use it on a daily basis. The SaaS model makes software accessible through an app or web browser. Some SaaS programs are free, but many require a monthly or annual subscription to maintain the service. Requiring no hardware installation or management, SaaS solutions are a big hit in the business world. Notable examples include Salesforce, Dropbox or Google Docs.
<h3><strong>Platform-as-a-Service</strong></h3>
<h3>PaaS is a cloud environment supporting web application development and deployment. PaaS supports the full lifecycle of applications, helping users build, test, deploy, manage and update all in one place. The service also includes development tools, middleware and business intelligence solutions. Notable examples include Windows Azure, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine.</h3>

<h1 class="text-primary"><strong>25 IAAS CLOUD COMPUTING COMPANIES BOOSTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF BUSINESS</strong></h1>
<h2><em>Here's a simple summary of complex Infrastructure as a Service (or IaaS) technology: cloud-based storage, hardware, servers, network components and other products that businesses can outsource to support their operations. And it's sweeping the globe.

Because nothing is located on-site, companies and organizations escape the headaches of housing, operating and maintaining equipment that's all done by the provider. IaaS cuts costs, too, as it eliminates the need for expensive IT equipment and large IT staffs. And the scalability potential for rapidly growing companies is almost infinite. Accessibility, too, is greatly improved.</em></h2>
