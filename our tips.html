<h3><strong>B.Tech</strong> is one of the most preferred courses after 12th. Over the years, the demand for engineering courses at the UG level has been increasing. However, the past trends say that only a limited number of specializations in B.Tech are attracting students, while some of the specializations receive poor turnout of students every year. While B.Tech Computer Science Engineering is one of the top courses in India that attract lakhs of students every year, a course like Mining Engineering, Metallurgy, Instrumentation Engineering and Textile Engineering receive a limited number of admissions. Even though these specializations have good career scope, lack of awareness/ difficulty level of the curriculum maybe some of the reasons for poor enrollment rate.

In this article, we tried to guide students on choosing the right specialization in B.Tech after Class 12th. Many students have questions in their mind like which B.Tech specialization is best after Class 12th, which B.Tech specialization land you in jobs with highest salary package etc. All your questions have been answered in this article.</h3>

<h3><strong>Tips to Choose Right B.Tech Branch after Class 12</strong>
From the table above, it is clear that students have many options in B.Tech, and choosing the right B.Tech branch may become a challenging task. We hope that the tips mentioned below will help you in choosing the best B.Tech branch -</h3>

<h3><strong>Career Aspiration & Goal</strong>: The first and foremost thing that a student must keep in mind is he/ she should pick up a right B.Tech branch based on career goal or aspiration. Most of you might have set a goal after passing Class 10th. Some students even set a goal when they are in Class 8th. If you are unable to set a goal, the below examples will help you in a better way.</h3>

<h3><strong>Example 1</strong>: Let us assume that you have passed Class 12th with 80%, and you scored highest marks/ good score in Mathematics and Physics. However, your performance in Chemistry was not up to the mark. For you, courses like Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Computer Science Engineering are the best options. These courses will have an equal combination of engineering mathematics and physics topics in the syllabus. Therefore, you can excel in these courses and secure a decent job.</h3>

<h3><strong>Example 2</strong>: Let us assume that your aim is to become an expert or professional in the field of Information Technology (IT). For you, the B.Tech course in IT can be the best option instead of Computer Science. A B.Tech degree in IT will land you in a better job with a lucrative salary package.</h3>
