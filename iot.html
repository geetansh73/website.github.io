<h1><strong>Internet of Things Definition</strong></h1>
<h3>In the simplest terms, the Internet of Things (IoT) is how we describe the digitally connected universe of everyday physical devices. These devices are embedded with internet connectivity, sensors and other hardware that allow communication and control via the web.</h3>
<h3></h3>

<h3>IoT makes once "dumb" devices "smarter" by giving them the ability to send data over the internet, allowing the device to communicate with people and other IoT-enabled things.</h3>

<h3>The connected "smart home" is a good example of IoT in action. Internet-enabled thermostats, doorbells, smoke detectors and security alarms create a connected hub where data is shared between physical devices and users can remotely control the "things" in that hub (i.e., adjusting temperature settings, unlocking doors, etc.) via a mobile app or website. </h3>

<h3>Far from being restricted to just the home, the Internet of Things can be found in an array of devices, industries and settings. From smart blackboards in school classrooms to medical devices that can detect signs of Parkinson's disease, IoT is rapidly making the world smarter by connecting the physical and the digital. </h3>

<h1><strong>In a nutshell, IoT works in the following way:</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Devices have hardware like sensors, for example, that collect data. </h3></li>
<li><h3>The data collected by the sensors is then shared via the cloud and integrated with software. </h3></li>
<li><h3>The software then analyzes and transmits the data to users via an app or website. </h3></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>INTERNET-OF-THINGS DEVICES</strong></h3>
<h2>Internet-of-Things devices are all around us; constantly transmitting data and "talking" with other IoT devices. We come across IoT devices almost everyday in the form of virtual assistants, "smart" electronics and in our wearable health trackers. Each Internet-of-Things device tracks information in real-time and relays it to us to help make our lives safer, healthier or more efficient.</h2>
<h3>Smart devices connect to an IoT platform, described by the experts at IoT For All as "the support software that connects everything in an IoT system." There are hundreds of IoT platforms and some are made by such industry giants as Oracle and IBM. </h3>
<h3>For more on how IoT works and where it's being used, check out any of the linked articles on this page. We've done deep dives on everything under the sun, but here are a few of our favorites:</h3>

<h2><strong>6 IOT IN HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS LEADING TO AN IMPROVED INDUSTRY</strong></h2>
<h3>Typically a quick adopter of new technology, the health sector continues to innovate using the vast Web-connected universe known as the Internet of Things.

A sampling: IoT technology keeps patients better connected to doctors via remote monitoring and virtual visits; it helps hospitals track staff and patients; IoT healthcare devices facilitate the care of chronic disease; IoT automates patient care workflow; it quickly culls, analyzes data and disseminates data to keep everyone on the same page; it reduces inefficiency and errors; it optimizes the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, which can result in lower drug prices; it maintains quality control and manages sensitive items while they're in transit; it can even lower healthcare costs by streamlining the overall process.</h3>
<h3 class="text-primary">EXAMPLES OF IOT MEDICAL DEVICES</h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Remote temperature monitoring for vaccines</h3></li>
<li><h3>Medical data transferring tools</h3></li>
<li><h3>Air quality sensors</h3></li>
<li><h3>Drug effectiveness tracking</h3></li>
<li><h3>Vital signs data capturing</h3></li>
<li><h3>Sleep monitor</h3></li>
<li><h3>Medication refill reminder technology</h3></li>
<li><h3>Remote care biometrics scanners</h3></li>
<li><h3>Sleep and safety tools for infants</h3></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>31 INDUSTRIAL-INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IIOT) COMPANIES ON THE RISE</strong></h2>
<h3>A subset of the far more sprawling Internet of Things, the Internet of Industrial Things (IIoT) is a network of connected devices that collect and transmit data. That data is then analyzed to extract insights that will optimize various manufacturing and commercial processes. Potential upsides include improved safety, cost savings and streamlined operations.</h3>

<h3>"The technology that powers an organization has become just as essential to success as the product or service a venture provides," tech entrepreneur Leon Hounshell wrote in Forbes. "Every sector - from finance to agriculture to transportation to healthcare to government to media - is subject to this truth. Business technology must now interconnect people with the proliferating devices, data and systems that populate our digitalized world via the internet.</h3>
<h3 class="text-primary">INDUSTRIAL IOT (IIOT) COMPANIES TO KNOW</h3>

<li><h3>Axzon</h3></li>
<li><h3>Plataine</h3></li>
<li><h3>Linx Global Manufacturing</h3></li>
<li><h3>Valarm</h3></li>
<li><h3>Fluidmesh Networks</h3></li>

<h2><strong>9 EXAMPLES OF HOW IOT IS MAKING CITIES SMART</strong></h2>
<h3>Cities all over the world are getting smarter, and that has everything to do with hyper-connectivity made possible by the ever-burgeoning Internet of Things - the vast network on which numerous linked devices share data that's analyzed and then acted upon to optimize conditions in a variety of sectors.</h3>

<h3>"The bottom line is that sensor technology in the IoT context is key," TeraData CTA Stephen Brobst told Information Age. "When I say IoT context, I mean that we get a view of the whole city across these different domains of the life of the city as it's captured in the sensor data."</h3>
<h2 class="text-primary">IOT IN SMART CITIES</h2>
<h3>IoT is being used in smart cities to make metropolis' safer, greener and more efficient. Internet-of-Things devices are being deployed throughout cities to measure and monitor everything from air quality to traffic and crime patterns.</h3>
