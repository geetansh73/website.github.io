<h1><strong>Software Engineering Definition</strong></h1>
<h3>Software engineering is the application of various approaches and practices for the development of computer software. Software engineering is directly related to computer science, where engineers take systematic and disciplined methods to the development, operation and maintenance of software.</h3>
<h3 class="text-primary"><strong>What is a Software Engineer?</strong></h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/04/25/b2/0425b20ac313ed8784a4dafe6b70c508.gif">
<h3>Software engineers are the people that make the digital world tick. They're responsible for revolutionary social media apps, like Twitter and Instagram, programming the future of autonomous transportation, robotics and even for this fantastic website you're reading right now. In short, whenever you're interacting with a website, app or digital screen, you're encountering the work of talented software engineers.</h3>

<h3>Software engineers are, in a nutshell, computer science professionals who use their vast knowledge of engineering principles, methods and languages to create, maintain and update computer software. The software engineering field is very broad, with engineers having various roles and technical expertise. Everything you see on your computer isn't just magic. It takes a team of highly dedicated engineers, using their varying skills to bring you the information, media or digital experience you want right away.</h3>
<h3>What sets software engineers apart from most other professions is their flexibility and agility. Whether it's switching back and forth between different, highly-complicated projects on a daily basis or keeping up with the latest industry technologies and trends, software engineers must stay nimble to provide the best digital experiences possible.</h3>

<h3>Another trait most successful engineers possess is the ability to effectively communicate. Engineers must work well with a team because projects nowadays involve many different technologies, coding languages and specialties. Most projects are compartmentalized to where each individual engineer works on a certain aspect and then passes it to the next engineer who continues the process. In this case, excellent communication skills are a must to ensure the product gets developed efficiently and works correctly for the user.</h3>

<h3><strong>Types of Engineers</strong></h3>
<h3>As stated above, engineers have unique skill sets that allow them to perform certain computer engineering tasks. It usually takes a whole team of different types of engineers to efficiently produce successful applications. Below are just a few of the most in-demand types of engineers.</h3>

<h3><strong>Front-End Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>Front-end engineers specialize in the development of customer-facing products. These user interface (UI) engineers deal with everything from cross-browser compatibility and fixing bug issues to incorporating design elements that provide the smoothest user experience on applications and websites.</h3>

<h3><strong>Back-End Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>Back-end engineers specialize in the logic, performance and coding of the application that users don't see. These engineers focus heavily on the code that is able to flawlessly execute every action you take when using an application. Back-end engineers rely on different databases, caches, programming languages and Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) to make sure the back-end is free of bugs and running smoothly.</h3>

<h3><strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>Full stack engineers are highly sought after because they have the knowledge and skills to handle both front- and back-end engineering tasks. Not only can these engineers create clean, working code on the backend, they also can implement design elements that help to create the best possible user experience.
</h3>
<h3><strong>Security Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>Security engineers are becoming highly sought after because of their importance in maintaining the health of an entity's cyber infrastructure during disruptions such as natural disasters or cyber attacks. Security engineers use varying forms of cybersecurity tools to make sure their databases, systems and infrastructure are always safe from harm. The need for security engineers will grow even larger as cyber threats grow larger and more advanced than ever before.</h3>

<h3><strong>DevOps Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>DevOps is a portmanteau of the phrases "software (dev)elopment" and "information-technology (op)erations." DevOps engineers are in high demand because they are familiar with the DevOps practices that help reduce the time it takes to take an application from inception to launch, without reducing the overall quality of the work. In other words, DevOps engineers are highly-skilled at offering the highest levels of efficiency for software development.</h3>

<h3><strong>Programming Languages</strong></h3>
<h3>Software engineers use languages to program computers to execute certain tasks. These programming languages serve as the basis for how applications and websites appear visually and how they carry out tasks. Most languages involve complicated structures that take engineers years to learn. Below are a few of the most popular programming languages used today:</h3>

<h3><strong>JavaScript</strong></h3>
<h3>In 2019, it was reported that 95% of all websites used JavaScript. This language plays a major role in front-end development to assure that interactive web pages run smoothly and function correctly. In addition, it’s an extremely flexible language that allows even beginners to pick up on it quickly.</h3>

<h3><strong>Python</strong></h3>
<h3>Python is an open source, user-friendly language that shines when it comes to code reusability and readability. The language is used for a wide variety of software engineering projects that range from application development and database creation to building AI and machine learning systems.</h3>

<h3><strong>C</strong></h3>
<h3>C is one of the original programming languages. Developed in 1971, C is still highly regarded for its ease-of-use when building high-performance applications. It's mainly being used today in burgeoning areas of technology, like virtual reality, computer graphics and gaming.


<h3><strong>Golang</strong></h3>
<h3>Golang (or Go, for short) is an increasingly popular programming language that has a similar syntax (rules for structured symbols) as C, but with enhanced memory security, readability and high-performance multiprocessing. This general purpose language, developed by Google, is used by companies like Uber, Docker and Medium to build fast and flexible applications.</h3>
<h3><strong>How to Become a Software Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3>Truth be told, there isn't one exact formula to become a software engineer. Sure, a degree in computer science helps you understand the basics of the world of software engineering, but that isn't the only way to get your foot in the door. Software engineers come from all walks of life, but are all united by one major characteristic: passion. Passion for the industry, the technologies you work on and the product you're building will propel you to a long, fruitful career as a software engineer. Not only should you be passionate about the code you're producing, but you should also be passionate about the product you're working on.</h3>

<h3>Along with a genuine interest in the field, software engineers must have an innate ability to communicate and act as team players. Everything needs to be communicated precisely so a line of code isn't written wrong or a design isn't installed incorrectly. One small miscommunication could result in the breakdown of an entire project. Successful software engineers make it a top priority to constantly sharpen their written and verbal communication skills to be the best asset possible to their team.</h3>
